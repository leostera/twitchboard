# Tw!tchBoard

## Authentication

We begin by calling the login command:

```
$ twitchboard login

# Opens default browser with login url
# 
# After which we are redirected to `http://localhost:50505/auth/callback` were 
# `twitchboard` is serving an endpoint that will handle this.
# 
# The endpoing will inspect the URL hash, and will send the `access_token` to
# another endpoint (`http://localhost:50505/auth/success/${token}`) and prompt
# the user to close the window.

Welcome, ostera!

You configuration is saved in ~/.twitchboard/secrets

You may start using twitchboard now :)
